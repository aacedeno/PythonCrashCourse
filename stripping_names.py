#Use a variable to represent a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
#Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
#Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
#Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
