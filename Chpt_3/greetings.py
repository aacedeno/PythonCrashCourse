#: Start with the list, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name


names = ['Ryan', 'Jhon', 'Zahir', "Monica"]

message_1 = f'Hello {names[0]}, how are you?'
message_2 = f'Hello {names[3]}, how are you?'


print(message_1)
print(message_2)
